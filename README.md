# gp-hunting
Lightweight hunting script, heavly using qb-target

# How is it work?
 - Basically you kill any animal from the list, then hold a Knife / SwichBlade / Dagger on your hand, then just target to the dead ped. 
 - Im not spawning animals, i let the player client to do it. 
 - Also because of this, it can be exploited. Basically they kill the animals, go away for like 100 meter. Soonest they get back those animals be there again. 

# Must have: 
 - meat, beef, pork, hide as a item, unless you change it.
